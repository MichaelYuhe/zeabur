# Multiple Environment Management

In a project development, it is often necessary to have multiple isolated environments, such as production environment, testing environment, and development environment.

Zeabur makes it easy for you to establish multiple different environments for the entire system.

## What is an Environment

An environment is where your service operates. It can be a server, a cluster, a cloud host, or even a local machine.

Different environments are independent of each other. They can have different settings, different services, and even different versions of services.

Zeabur can help you establish multiple environments in a project.

## Why You Need Multiple Environments

In a project, you may need to deploy your service to different environments. For example, you may need to deploy your service to the production environment and the development environment.

The production environment is for serving your customers. It should be stable and reliable. You should not frequently deploy services to the production environment.

The development environment is for serving developers. It should be easy to deploy and test. You should frequently deploy your services to the development environment.

## How to Manage Multiple Environments

### Step 1: Create a New Environment

Click the create environment button in the upper left corner to create a new environment.

After creation, all the services in your current project will be automatically copied and redeployed in the new environment.

### Step 2: Bind Different Branches

For the deployed code, you can bind different branches of the same service in different environments.

Click on the service, go to the settings page, and scroll down to **Switch Branch** to select the branch you want to bind to in that environment.

For example, when you choose the `dev` branch for a service, the status of the service is bound to the `dev` branch. You can then assign a domain for the `dev` environment to instantly view the online status of the `dev` environment.
