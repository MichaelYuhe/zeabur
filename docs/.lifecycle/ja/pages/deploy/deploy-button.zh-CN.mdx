# One-Click Deployment

By using our one-click deployment button, you can easily deploy your service to Zeabur with just one click. The button can be used in any markdown or html file. It can convert any [Zeabur template](https://zeabur.com/templates) into a project that will be automatically deployed on Zeabur.

## Function of the Button

The deployment button is a simple html code snippet. You can copy the code snippet and paste it into any markdown or html file. Each button will redirect users to the desired template. The template can be a single service or a set of services determined by the template author.

The button can also end with the author's referral code, and for every new user who registers and upgrades to a paid plan using the referral code, the author will receive a $5 credit.

## Copying the Button

Each button is associated with a template, and only the template author can generate the button.

To copy the button, you need to go to the **Templates** tab on the [Zeabur Dashboard](https://dash.zeabur.com/account) in your account page, where you can see a list of templates that you have created.

Select the desired template and click the share button. This will bring up a popup containing the button code.

If you choose to enable the referral code, the button code will include the referral code, which is your username on Zeabur.

## Use Cases

This is the best way to share your project with the world. Anyone can easily deploy your project with just one click.

For example, you can paste the button in the following locations:

- README files on GitHub
- Personal websites
- Documentation and tutorials
- Social media profiles

## Prerequisites

You need to create a template first in order to get the deployment button. You can create a template on the [Zeabur Dashboard](https://dash.zeabur.com/create-template).

As shown in the image below, you need to fill in the template name, description, and select the services to be included in the template, just like filling out a form, to create your template.

## Earn Rewards

Just as mentioned at the beginning of this document, for every new user who registers and upgrades to a paid plan using your referral code, you will receive a $5 credit. You can use the credit to pay for your own services.

You can read more detailed instructions in our [Referral Documentation](../billing/referral).
