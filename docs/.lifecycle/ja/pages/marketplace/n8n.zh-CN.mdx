# Deploy n8n

[n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) is an extensible workflow automation tool. Adopting a fair-code distribution model, n8n always has visible source code, can be self-hosted, and allows you to add your own custom functions, logic, and applications. n8n's node-based approach makes it highly flexible, allowing you to connect anything to anything.

This article will show you how to deploy n8n with PostgreSQL on Zeabur.

## Step One: Create a Project

First, we need to create a project on Zeabur. Go to the [Projects](https://dash.zeabur.com/projects) page, where you will see all your projects, the "Create Project" button at the end of all projects.

Click the **Create Project** button and enter the project name, and you will get a new project.

## Step Two: Deploy PostgreSQL Service

n8n will store user identity data in a PostgreSQL database. Click "Create Service," then choose "Service Marketplace," where you will find PostgreSQL in the list.

After selecting the **PostgreSQL** service, Zeabur will automatically start deploying the service for you.

## Step Three: Create a Database

In order for the n8n service to run properly, we need to create a database named `n8n` in the PostgreSQL database.

Generally, you need a PostgreSQL client to connect to the PostgreSQL service and create a database. However, Zeabur provides a convenient way to create a database.

In your PostgreSQL service, you can find an option tab called **Database**, where you can manage your databases at your fingertips.

**n8n** needs a database named `n8n`, so we need to create a database named `n8n`.
Enter `n8n` in the input field, then click the **Create** button, and Zeabur will create a database named `n8n` for you.

## Step Four: Deploy n8n Service

After successfully creating the PostgreSQL service and setting up the database, you can now start deploying n8n.
Go back to the project page where you just created the **PostgreSQL** service, click **Create Service**, then choose **Service Marketplace**, and you will find n8n in the list.

After selecting the **n8n** service, Zeabur will automatically start deploying the service for you.

<Callout>
  If you deployed n8n before deploying PostgreSQL, you need to restart the n8n service after deploying the PostgreSQL service to ensure that n8n gets the correct database connection information.

## Step Five: Bind a Domain Name

In the "Domain" section of the n8n service in the Zeabur Console, you can bind a domain name.

This domain can be your own domain or a free domain provided by Zeabur.

For information on how to bind a domain name to your service, please refer to [Domain Binding](../deploy/domain-binding).

## Step Six: Set Up Your Account

After the deployment is completed, you can access your n8n service using the domain name you bound. You will see the following page:

Follow the instructions on the page to set up your n8n account. Once setup is complete, you can start using n8n normally.
