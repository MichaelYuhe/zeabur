# Deploying Halo Service

[Halo](https://halo.run/) is a powerful and easy-to-use open source website building tool, with a wide range of templates and plugins to help you create your ideal site.

This article will teach you how to easily deploy your own Halo service on Zeabur through the service marketplace and bind your own domain.

## Step One: Create a Project

First, we need to create a project on Zeabur. Go to the [Project List](https://dash.zeabur.com/projects) page, where you will see many of your projects, and the "Create Project" button is at the end of all projects.

## Step Two: Deploy PostgreSQL Service

Currently, Halo service supports only PostgreSQL database on Zeabur. Before creating a Halo service, you need to deploy a PostgreSQL service and create a database.

Click on "Create Service" and select "Service Marketplace", where you will find PostgreSQL in the list.

After selecting PostgreSQL, you can give the service a custom name, then click deploy.

## Step Three: Create a Database

In order for the Halo service to run properly, we need to create a database named `halo` in the PostgreSQL database.

First, connect to your PostgreSQL service using any PostgreSQL client. In this article, we will use [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/app-psql.html).

You can find the corresponding psql connection command or other connection information in the "Connection" section of the PostgreSQL service in the Zeabur console.

For example:

```bash
psql postgresql://root:password@infra.zeabur.com:12345
```

Next, enter the following command in psql to create the `halo` database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE halo;
```

## Step Four: Deploy Halo Service

In the Zeabur console, click on "Create Service" and select "Service Marketplace", where you will find Halo in the list.

![Deploy Halo Service](/marketplace/halo/deploy-halo.zh-CN.png)

After selecting Halo, you can give the service a custom name, then click deploy.

Please note that since we have already deployed the PostgreSQL service before deploying Halo, Zeabur
will automatically inject the relevant environment variables of PostgreSQL into the Halo
service, so there is no need to manually configure the database information.

If you deploy Halo first without deploying PostgreSQL,
you will need to restart the Halo service after deploying the PostgreSQL
service to allow Halo to obtain the correct database connection information.

## Step Five: Bind Domain Name

In the Zeabur console, go to the "Domain" section of the Halo service, where you can bind a domain name to it. This domain can be your own domain or a free domain provided by Zeabur.

For information on how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Domain Binding](../deploy/domain-binding).

## Step Six: Login and Set Up Halo

After binding, you can click on the domain to enter Halo's initialization page and follow the prompts to complete the initialization before using the Halo service.
