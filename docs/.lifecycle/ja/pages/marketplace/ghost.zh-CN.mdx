# Deploy Ghost Service

[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is a powerful application suitable for new media creators to publish, share, and grow their content business.

This article will teach you how to easily deploy your own Ghost service on Zeabur through the service marketplace, and bind your own domain.

## Step 1: Create a Project

First, we need to create a project on Zeabur. Go to the [Project List](https://dash.zeabur.com/projects) page, where you will see many of your projects, and the "Create Project" button is at the end of all projects.

## Step 2: Deploy MySQL service

Currently, Ghost services in Zeabur only support the MySQL database. Before creating a Ghost service, you need to deploy a MySQL service (the database will be automatically created by the Ghost service).

Click on "Create Service" and select "Service Marketplace", where you will find MySQL in the list.

Click on the project to complete the deployment.

## Step 3: Deploy Ghost Service

In the Zeabur console, click on "Create Service" and select "Service Marketplace", where you will find Ghost in the list.

Click on the project to complete the deployment.

Note that because we have already deployed the MySQL service before deploying Ghost, Zeabur
will automatically inject the relevant environment variables of the MySQL into the Ghost
service, so there is no need to manually configure the database information.

If you deployed Ghost first without deploying MySQL, you need to restart the Ghost service after deploying the MySQL
service in order for Ghost to obtain the correct database connection information.

After deployment, immediately click the pause button to pause the Ghost service, then we will proceed to set up the domain.

## Step 4: Bind a Domain

In the Zeabur console, in the "Domain" section of the Ghost service, you can bind a domain to it, which can be your own domain or a free domain provided by Zeabur.

For information on how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Domain Binding](../deploy/domain-binding).

After adding the domain, open the "Environment Variables" and modify `url` to the domain you just bound. After the modification, Ghost will automatically restart.

## Step 5: Log in and configure Ghost

After binding, you can click on the domain to access the homepage of Ghost, and add `/ghost` at the end of the domain to access the administrator settings interface of Ghost.

After completing the configuration, you can start your writing journey.
