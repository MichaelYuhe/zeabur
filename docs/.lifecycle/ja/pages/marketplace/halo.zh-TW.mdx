# Deploying Halo Service

[Halo](https://halo.run/) is a powerful and easy-to-use open source website building tool, with a rich set of templates and plugins to help you build your ideal site.

This article will teach you how to easily deploy your own Halo service on Zeabur through the service marketplace and bind your own domain.

## Step One: Create a Project

First, we need to create a project on Zeabur. Please go to the [project list](https://dash.zeabur.com/projects) page, where you will see many of your projects, and the "Create Project" button is at the end of all projects.

## Step Two: Deploy PostgreSQL Service

Currently, Halo service only supports PostgreSQL database in Zeabur. Before creating the Halo service, you need to deploy a PostgreSQL service and create a database.

Click "Create Service" and select "Service Marketplace" where you will find PostgreSQL in the list.

After selecting PostgreSQL, you can give a custom name to the service, and then click deploy.

## Step Three: Create a Database

To enable the Halo service to function properly, we need to create a database named `halo` in the PostgreSQL database.

First, use any PostgreSQL client to connect to your PostgreSQL service. In this article, we will use [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/app-psql.html) for connection.

You can find the corresponding psql connection command or other connection information in the "Connection" section of the PostgreSQL service in the Zeabur console.

For example:

```bash
psql postgresql://root:password@infra.zeabur.com:12345
```

Then, enter the following command in psql to create the `halo` database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE halo;
```

## Step Four: Deploy Halo Service

In the Zeabur console, click "Create Service" and select "Service Marketplace" where you will find Halo in the list.

After selecting Halo, you can give a custom name to the service, and then click deploy.

Note that, because we have already deployed the PostgreSQL service before deploying Halo, Zeabur will automatically inject the relevant environment variables of PostgreSQL into the Halo service, so there is no need to manually configure the database information.

If you deploy Halo first without deploying PostgreSQL, you will need to restart the Halo service after deploying the PostgreSQL service in order for Halo to obtain the correct database connection information.

## Step Five: Bind Domain

In the Zeabur console, in the "Domain" section of the Halo service, you can bind a domain to it. This domain can be your own domain or a free domain provided by Zeabur.

For information on how to bind a domain to your service, please refer to [Domain Binding](../deploy/domain-binding).

## Step Six: Login and Configure Halo

After binding, you can click on the domain to enter the Halo initialization page, and follow the prompts to complete the initialization and start using the Halo service.
