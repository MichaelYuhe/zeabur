# Deploy Flask Projects

This article will teach you how to deploy a Flask application to Zeabur with just one click.

## 1. Create a Flask Project

You can view an example of a Flask project at [flask-template](https://github.com/zeabur/flask-template). The example project is very simple and includes a route that returns a string.

```python
from flask import Flask
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return "Welcome, this is a Flask app deployed on Zeabur"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=os.getenv("PORT", default=5000), host='0.0.0.0')
```

Please note that Zeabur uses the environment variable `PORT` to obtain the port number to be forwarded. Therefore, you need to set this environment variable and use `os.getenv` or other methods to set the port number in the application.

Zeabur uses `python app.py` or `python main.py` to start the Flask application, so your project should include one of these files and the command required to run the Flask application.

You need to write the external packages required by the project in the requirements.txt, Pipfile, or Pipfile.lock file so that Zeabur can automatically install them before building.

## 2. Deploy the Application

In your project, click the **Deploy service** or **Add new service** button and select **Deploy your source code**.

Search for the Flask application repository you want to deploy and click on import. Your Flask application will then automatically start deploying.
