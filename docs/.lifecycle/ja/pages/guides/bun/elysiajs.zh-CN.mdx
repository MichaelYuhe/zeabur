# Deploy ElysiaJS Project

[ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com) is a fast and friendly Bun web framework.

This documentation will guide you on how to deploy the ElysiaJS project on Zeabur.

## Step 1: Create ElysiaJS Project

### Method 1: Using Bun

#### Install Bun

Elysia is based on [Bun](https://bun.sh/), so you need to install Bun first.

```bash
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

#### Initialize ElysiaJS Project

```bash
bun create elysia app-name
```

After the initialization is complete, you will get an ElysiaJS project in the `app-name` directory.

```bash
cd app-name
bun run dev
```

Now, you can visit http://localhost:8080 to see the result.

#### Upload to GitHub

If you want to deploy your ElysiaJS project on Zeabur, you need to first upload the code to GitHub.

Simply create a new repository on GitHub and push the code to the repository. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

### Method 2: Using Zeabur Template
