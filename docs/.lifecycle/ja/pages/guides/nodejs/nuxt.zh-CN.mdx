# Deploying Nuxt Project

Deploy your Nuxt project on Zeabur.

### Step 1: Create Nuxt Project (Optional)

Open the terminal and run the following command:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npx']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm dlx nuxi init <project-name>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npx nuxi init <project-name>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, you need to install dependencies:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  It is important to note that due to the different structure of `node_modules` in pnpm compared to other package managers, you need to use `--shamefully-hoist` to install the packages. Also, ensure that before deployment, you have added a `.npmrc` file in the root directory of your project and included `shamefully-hoist=true` in the file.
</Callout>


````.npmrc filename=".npmrc" copy
shamefully-hoist=true
````

### Step 2: Deploy Nuxt Application

In your project, click on the **Deploy service** or **Add new service** button, and select **Deploy your source code**.
