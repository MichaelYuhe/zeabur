# Deploy Deno Project

This article will teach you how to deploy your [Deno](https://deno.land/) project at Zeabur.

## Creating a Deno application using TypeScript (optional)

- First, install Deno on your computer.

- You can find more detailed instructions in the [Deno official documentation](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation).

Create a new file `main.ts`.

```bash
touch main.ts
```

Add the following content to your `main.ts`.

Remember to modify the value of the port parameter `port` in the `serve` function to `Deno.env.get("PORT")` so that the application can correctly listen on the environment variable `PORT` provided by Zeabur.

```typescript
// in main.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.140.0/http/server.ts";

function handler(_req: Request): Response {
  return new Response("Hello, this is a Deno (https://deno.land/) web app deployed on Zeabur (https://zeabur.com)");
}

serve(handler, { port: Deno.env.get("PORT") });
```

Create a new file `deno.json` and add the following `start` command to the `tasks` field.

```bash
touch deno.json
# in deno.json
{
  "tasks": {
    "start": "deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read main.ts"
  }
}
```

## Developing the project

Run `deno task start` to start the development server.

```bash
deno task start
```

Next, you can start modifying the code to develop your TypeScript project.

Once you are finished, initialize a GitHub repository for it and upload it to your GitHub.

## Deploying the project

In your project, click the **Deploy New Service** button and select **Deploy your code**.

Search for the TypeScript code repository you want to deploy, and click import, your TypeScript application will automatically start deploying.

After deployment, you can refer to the [Bind Domain](../../deploy/domain-binding) documentation to learn how to bind a public domain that allows external access for your TypeScript project.
