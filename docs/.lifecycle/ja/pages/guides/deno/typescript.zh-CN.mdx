# Deploy Deno Application

This article will teach you how to deploy your [Deno](https://deno.land/) application on Zeabur.

## Building Deno Application with TypeScript (Optional)

- First, install Deno on your computer.

- You can find more detailed instructions in the [Deno official documentation](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation).

Create a new file `main.ts`.

```bash
touch main.ts
```

Add the following content to your `main.ts`.

Remember to modify the value of the `port` connection argument in the `serve` function to `Deno.env.get("PORT")`, so that the application can correctly listen on the environment variable PORT given by Zeabur.

```typescript
// in main.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.140.0/http/server.ts";

function handler(_req: Request): Response {
  return new Response("Hello, this is a Deno (https://deno.land/) web app deployed on Zeabur (https://zeabur.com)");
}

serve(handler, { port: Deno.env.get("PORT") });
```

Create a new file `deno.json` and add the following `start` command to the `tasks` field.

```bash
touch deno.json
# in deno.json
{
  "tasks": {
    "start": "deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read main.ts"
  }
}
```

## Developing the Application

Execute `deno task start` to start the development server.

```bash
deno task start
```

Now, you can start modifying the code to develop your TypeScript application.

Once you are done, initialize a GitHub repository for it and upload it to your GitHub.

## Deploying the Application

In your project, click the 'Deploy New Service' button and select 'Deploy your source code'.

Search for the TypeScript code repository you want to deploy, and click import. Your TypeScript application will start deploying automatically.

After the deployment is complete, you can refer to the Bind Domain Name file to learn how to bind a publicly accessible domain name for your TypeScript application.
